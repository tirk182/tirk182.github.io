 My name is Bob. I have a degree in 'Telecommunications Electronics' and work for a large telecom company. I have just started programming / coding for fun stuff (pet projects and other stuff for learning, etc) for the last year.

I have always been fascinated with science & technology and am curious about many things. I want to use this website to capture/archive some of my work and to share that with others.

When I am not working, I am either reading up different stuff related to technology, linux, etc or playing guitar or binge-watching TV shows on Netflix and other streaming services.
