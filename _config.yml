  This is my attempt at doing a website on github.io and using jekyll. Trying to learn these different ways of doing things. Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://yourdomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
#twitter_username: jekyllrb
github_username:  tirk182
