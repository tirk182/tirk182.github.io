Well, so after working for a company for 20 years I am being surplused. Not for any performance issues since I graded out like always (as tops in team).
It's because of where my work location is situated. Since I am not in a hub city, I am deemed expendable regards of how good of an employee I am. Not just me though. 1000's got hit. You will just not see it in the media.
