Well so after working for a company for 20 years i am being surplused. Not for any performance issues since i graded out like always as tops in team.
. It's because of where my work location is. Since I am not in a hub city, I am deemed expendable regards of how good of an employee i am. not just 
me though. 1000's got hit.
